> Brio is a tool for FFXIV to enhance the GPosing experience. 
Brio is currently in alpha, and as such, there may be bugs. If you find any, please report them!

## Changes from upstream

This is a personal fork of [Etheirys/Brio](https://github.com/Etheirys/Brio) with the following additions:

### Anchor
Allows you to attach an anchor to any bone and have other bones follow it in real-time.
- Set an anchor on a source bone
- Any number of target bones can subscribe to that anchor
- Target bones update continuously to match the anchor's transform during GPose

## Features
* Actor Posing
  * While animating
  * Adjust actor positions without them resetting
  * Overlay and graphical posing modes
* Creation and Deletion of GPose actors (up to 239)
* Creation of custom lights
* Edit Actor Appearances
* Offline import and export of MCDF files onto GPose actors
* Change the Penumbra collection applied to GPose actors
* Play XAT's .xcp camera files
* Add/Remove/Blend animations on GPose actors (and adjust their speed)
* Change the active festivals and apply up to 4 at once (Moonfire Faire for fireworks etc)
* Add/Remove Status Effects on GPose actors
* Control Time/Weather in both the Overworld and GPose
* Redraw control of GPose actors
* NPC Appearance Hack (Allows you to apply NPC appearances to players without breaking tools like Penumbra)
